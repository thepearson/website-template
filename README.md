# website-template

This is a simple template for starting a website. It sets up an Ingres ([traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/)), an App ([Next 13](https://nextjs.org/)) and a database ([pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/)).

## Getting started

### Installation

  - Clone the repository
  - Run `docker-compose up -d`

### Usage

  - Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser to access the website
  - Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to access the traefik  (provided the ports are mapped in the docker-compose.yml file)
